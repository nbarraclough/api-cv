# What is this

When I first applied to join Nylas, I wanted to join the Implementation Engineering team. 

I was trying to come up with a fun way to get their attention, so I thought I could turn my CV into an API (since the core product of Nylas is an API). 

You could GET individual parts of my CV, or GET the whole thing in a JSON object. I guess it was kind of an API, but I think there's a lot of room to improve here (like a lot).

I know the files are a mess, but I don't plan on improving this.

# Did it work?

Kind of. I had it hosted on Heroku, so it would keep spinning down due to the lack of activity. I'd do it differently if I had to do it again, but it was a fun excuse to write some Python & use flask.

In the end I didn't join the Implementation Engineering team, and joined Customer Success in our London office. I'm now in the Marketing team as a PMM in Chicago.

# What would I do differently?

- Structure it differently
- Send over a Postman collection
- Use a better landing page to guide visitors to explore the endpoints
- Have some docs
- Have it actually do something rather than just return a JSON object
